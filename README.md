# Project 3 - Data Engineering Track

Overview of the project and its purpose:

Dress codes have been a topic of debate for students, teachers, parents, & administrators for decades.
This project performs ETL on a dataset of dress code restrictions in US High Schools from 2018-2019

A Jupyter Notebook file performs 79 steps of transformation and denormalisation.
There is output of 5 transformed CSV files.

Ethical considerations for dress codes can be dicey. There can be biases based upon race, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
